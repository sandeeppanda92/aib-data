* Optimize our implementation of the Tendermint consensus algorithm and p2p network.
* Research, design, and implement improvements to the consensus and related protocols.
* Help formalize the specification of the Tendermint consensus and ensure the implementation adheres to the spec.
* Research, design, and implement improvements to Tendermint subprotocols.
* Enhance the robustness of the Tendermint subprotocols under adversarial conditions.
* Develop simulations for testing the networking layer under various configurations and attack models.
* Mentor junior engineers and support the growth and health of the team.
* Review pull requests and provide valuable feedback to members of the team and open source contributors.

### What we offer:
* The opportunity to build the future of the internet.
* An exciting role building open source software.
* Flexible work schedule.
* Travel stipend for conferences and in person collaboration.
* At least 4 weeks of paid vacation.

### About our application process:
Qualified candidates can expect to go through a 4 step interview process. The first interview will be a call to assess cultural fit and to make sure our goals are aligned.

If we think there is a good fit, you'll have a call with one of our project managers to learn more about your skills and attitudes toward teamwork. If it's clear that you'd be a good addition to the team, we’ll ask you to complete a technical task for which you will be compensated.

If your technical task displays a high level of quality and care we will set up a final interview with our CEO or CTO.

The process can take up to 3 weeks.
