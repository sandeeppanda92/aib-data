## Blockchain Frameworks

### Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is an ABCI framework written in Golang that affords you all the tools you need to rapidly develop robust blockchains and blockchain applications which are interoperable with the Cosmos Hub. It is a blockchain development 'starter-pack' of common blockchain modules while not enforcing their use thus giving maximum flexibility for application customization. It is perfect to build highly-customizable public proof-of-stake blockchains.

WARNING: The Cosmos SDK is under heavy development and it's [not yet ready](/roadmap) for release. Keep up to date with Cosmos SDK news [on our blog](https://blog.cosmos.network).

### Application-Blockchain Interface (ABCI)

The Application-Blockchain Interface (ABCI) allows you to deploy the business logic of your blockchain application in any language. It handles the connection with the underlying Tendermint engine, which is responsible for the networking and consensus parts of the software. With the ABCI, you can deploy any type of blockchain application - public or private - in no time.

### Ethermint

Ethermint is a blazing fast Proof-of-Stake implementation of Ethereum that is built on top of Tendermint using the ABCI protocol. Ethermint lets you use the full power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in connection to other blockchains (with IBC) on the Cosmos Network.

### Lotion

Lotion is a new way to create blockchain apps in JavaScript, which aims to make writing new blockchains fast and fun. It builds on top of Tendermint using the ABCI protocol. Lotion lets you write secure, scalable applications that can easily interoperate with other blockchains on the Cosmos Network using IBC.

## Blockchain Consensus

### Tendermint

Tendermint is the byzantine-fault tolerant consensus engine behind Cosmos SDK, Ethermint, and Lotion. Tendermint applications can be written in any programming language.
