Most online media companies rely on ad-generated revenue, which often means there’s no room for quality editorial content. This results in a proliferation of “bite-size” sponsored content from online media companies such as Buzzfeed, Vice, Vox and <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/" data-href="http://www.refinery29.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Refinery29</em></a>. Only a handful (literally) of these companies make over $100m annually. Most of their sales come from corporate sponsors such as Levi’s and Nike. Many other serious editorial content companies have mostly gone bankrupt. (Disclaimer: I’m an early investor of Refinery29.)</p><p name="574b" id="574b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medium.com set out a mission in 2012 to rethink a new economic model determining which contents are told, clicked on, and compensated. Earlier this year, Medium decided to <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/medium-layoff-announcment-ev-williams/" data-href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/medium-layoff-announcment-ev-williams/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pare down the company</a>. It takes a visionary to say no to big corporate sponsors and Ev Williams is definitely one of them. He refused to turn Medium into just another ad-based media platform. Most recently Medium introduced a subscription model: readers can pay $5 a month for a membership.</p><figure name="aca4" id="aca4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 358px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 51.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*r9HxNOFH-I-E6UDb86liqA.png" data-width="1005" data-height="514" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*r9HxNOFH-I-E6UDb86liqA.png"></div></figure><p name="8a82" id="8a82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This solves Medium’s short term problem of running the company, although it’s not yet clear is how authors are compensated.</p><blockquote name="0ed6" id="0ed6" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Steve Jobs has solved this problem</blockquote><p name="5781" id="5781" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">This happened in the music industry during the transition to digital music. Apple opened the iTunes Music Store on April 28, 2003, with 200,000 songs. (Simultaneously, Apple released its third-generation iPod.) This was a brilliant way to solve three problems: consumption, distribution and micro-<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">payment</em> of digital music. After all, the credit card processors would benefit from an increased volume of transactions. But they may not be entirely pleased with an increased volume of transactions from Apple, given the way iTunes handles payments for 99-cent apps and $9.99 albums. Apple aggregates purchases made over several days into batches, reducing the per-transaction fees that it pays to Visa and Mastercard.</p><p name="81f9" id="81f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medium has solved the problems of consumption and distribution. The Medium app offers a delightful user experience when creating, distributing, and consuming content. But there’s no easy way to rewards the content creators.</p><blockquote name="62f4" id="62f4" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">There’s no simple mechanism for micropayment for online digital content</em></blockquote><p name="a0f7" id="a0f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Brave, a new browser startup headed by a former CEO of Mozilla, has tried to address this by building a new browser which has a built-in digital wallet and ad-block. It recently added the <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/brave-announces-blockchain-digital-advertising-platform-with-ethereum-based-token-rewards-for-users/" data-href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/brave-announces-blockchain-digital-advertising-platform-with-ethereum-based-token-rewards-for-users/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cryptocurrency token Ethereum</a> as a way to reward content creators. It is definitely a brave new approach, but we have seen browser wars and know how the story ends. There is also an upcoming W3C web payment standards could be leveraged for micro payments as well, but these improvements are a long way in the future.</p><blockquote name="8da1" id="8da1" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Don’t be Evil.
