Public AIB Data - e.g. employees, careers, events

## Adding a job listing

Create a new file in `./md/careers`. The name of the file is important. The first segment should be either: `technical`, `operations`, or `community`. Prefixing your filename with anything other than those **WILL CAUSE THE CAREER TO NOT BE DISPLAYED**. Examples of valid filenames for careers:

    technical-developer-devops.md
    technical-research-scientist.md
    operations-office-manager.md
    operations-admin-assistant.md
    community-graphic-designer.md

The first line of your markdown file should be a `<h1>` tag. This is the title of the job and will be used everywhere we list jobs. Like this:

    # Software Developer - Ethereum
