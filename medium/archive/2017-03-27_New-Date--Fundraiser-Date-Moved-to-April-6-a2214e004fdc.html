The date we announced for our fundraiser is almost here and everybody wants to inspect the terms and conditions and look under the hood before embarking on this adventure of cosmic proportions.</p><p name="28c5" id="28c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well today, we finally answer your calling with several critical updates:</p><h3 name="c584" id="c584" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Limitations on US Funders and Elsewhere</h3><p name="8d01" id="8d01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One of the most frequent questions we have received was whether US persons can participate in the fundraiser. After all, there is no reason to think that the proportion of potential Cosmonauts in the land of the free would be any lower than elsewhere. It would be easy to block US persons and call it a day, but this isn’t a satisfying solution. So, we spent a lot of time with our lawyers to analyze the situation.</p><p name="349f" id="349f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a series of meetings last week, we’ve finally come to a decision — we’re lifting the general ban on US residents and citizens! We’re super excited about this outcome, and hope you are too.</p><p name="c2a3" id="c2a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We reserve the right to block contributions from certain few states within the US as we discover more about state-level regulations. The state of Washington &amp; New Hampshire are top on the list of states we want to block. We will finalize any such decisions by Wednesday the 29th.</p><p name="b966" id="b966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will still take care to block certain countries on the OFAC sanctions list. The full list is <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx" data-href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 name="3048" id="3048" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Fundraiser Instructions</h3><p name="d88c" id="d88c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The flow of our fundraiser has also been finished and is with our security auditors, Smart Contract Solutions, for a final review. They are among the most experienced companies when it comes to the security of cryptocurrency fundraisers and have done past security audits of Golem, DFINITY, ether.camp and WeTrust. We will be publishing the full fundraiser flow with instructions on Wednesday, and Smart Contract Solutions will also be publishing their security review of the process.</p><p name="c0e2" id="c0e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We got our first review results from Smart Contract Solutions just over a week ago. No severe security issues were found, but we did get some great recommendations, so we decided to implement a few improvements. Not only is our new fundraiser flow now more secure, it’s also much easier to follow. All you need to do is write down and remember 12 words — and you can even generate these words on an offline computer.</p><p name="393d" id="393d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re very happy with this new flow and believe that it’s worth the wait, so please bear with us while we do a final round of audits.</p><h3 name="7b84" id="7b84" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Fundraiser Contributor Terms</h3><p name="8166" id="8166" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We are also releasing the Cosmos Contribution Terms for the fundraiser. This is a comprehensive document that outlines the risks, rights and obligations of the fundraiser. Anybody planning to participate in the fundraiser needs to carefully review the document. And please let us know if you have any questions or comments.</p><p name="6df8" id="6df8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we make any further modifications to these terms, we will post a separate blog post about the updates, so be sure to check our website prior to the fundraiser.</p><p name="fe0f" id="fe0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/raw/master/fundraiser/Interchain%20Cosmos%20Contribution%20Terms%20-%20Penultimate%20Draft.pdf" data-href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/raw/master/fundraiser/Interchain%20Cosmos%20Contribution%20Terms%20-%20Penultimate%20Draft.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cosmos Contribution Terms Penultimate Draft</a></p><h3 name="21d5" id="21d5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Pre-Fund Amounts</h3><p name="6982" id="6982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This journey started quite a long time ago, and without the support of some early, irreverent Cosmonauts, we wouldn’t be here today. Thus, the foundation will recommend allocating a corresponding amount of atoms to those funders.</p><p name="b9bf" id="b9bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, we received a commitment for USD $300,000 from lead donors in August 2016. At that time, we didn’t know much about what the Cosmos fundraiser would look like, so we recommended that those early donors be allocated 5% of the total atom supply for their support.</p><p name="ac40" id="ac40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, we received a number of contributions from pre-contributors and strategic partners. Those are also people who supported the project substantially earlier and/or are providing crucial support in other areas. We raised a total of USD $1,329,472 from these 13 individuals and entities. We did give discounts between 15% and 25% on these contributions. The total amount of atoms allocated to pre-contributors and strategic partners is 16,856,718.</p><h3 name="2ff3" id="2ff3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Bug Bounty Program Winners!</h3><p name="d5b6" id="d5b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We are happy to announce the three winners of our bug bounty program. They are the ones who dug into the code to find the weaknesses in our fundraiser flows. The winners are:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3dd2" id="3dd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Denis Milicevic</strong> — for pointing out an issue in our Solidity code for emergency ETH return addresses. Thank you Denis, please accept our bounty for 3 bitcoins worth of atoms.</li><li name="8f64" id="8f64" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Piotr</strong> — for independently finding the above issue, but also identifying a non-critical bug wherein the smart contract cannot be killed after being halted. Thank you Piotr, we’d like to grant you 3 bitcoins or 3 bitcoins’ worth of atoms.</li><li name="401d" id="401d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Christopher Goes</strong> — for identifying a UX error in the web wallet backup flow where we show both a failure and success notification when the wallet backup fails for whatever reason. Thank you Christopher! We’ve already credited Christopher with 3 bitcoins.</li></ul><p name="eea6" id="eea6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">When we release the new fundraiser flow on Wednesday, we look forward to another round of public review from the community. Thank you for your support!</p><h3 name="977c" id="977c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Fundraiser Date</h3><p name="2fd4" id="2fd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The date we had announced for our fundraiser was this Friday, March 31. We would be able to go ahead with this date, but we don’t feel we have given all of you enough time to review the terms, familiarize yourselves with the fundraising structure and ask your questions. Additionally, the new and improved fundraiser flow needs a new round of review. For this reason, we decided to push back the date of the fundraiser by six days to Thursday April 6th, 6am Pacific Time.</p><p name="7e78" id="7e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are a few other things coming up in the next days:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3756" id="3756" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Tuesday 3/28</strong> — AmA with Cryptocopia community at 3pm EDT (Slack: cryptocopia.slack.com)</li><li name="766b" id="766b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Wednesday 3/29</strong> — AmA with CoinFund community at 3pm EDT (Slack: coinfund.slack.com)</li><li name="9270" id="9270" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Wednesday 3/29</strong> — Publication of fundraiser flow and instructions</li><li name="178e" id="178e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Thursday 3/30</strong> — Completion of second security audit</li><li name="dced" id="dced" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Friday 3/31</strong> — Publication of Cosmos Constitution</li><li name="afb4" id="afb4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Thursday 4/6</strong> — Cosmos Fundraiser begins!</li></ul><p name="b903" id="b903" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">We hope you are as excited as we are to get to the end of this long road, to start an even longer cosmos journey.</p></div></div></section><section name="543e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="ccac" id="ccac" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://gist.github.com/1e7303cc49b87b11954a4c510541670c" data-href="https://gist.github.com/1e7303cc49b87b11954a4c510541670c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gist.github.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section>
