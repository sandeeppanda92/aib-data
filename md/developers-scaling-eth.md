# Scaling Ethereum

## Ethermint

The first approach is to use [Ethermint](https://ethermint.zone) to deploy your Dapp. Ethermint is a Proof-of-Stake implementation of the Ethereum virtual machine. It implements the Web3 standard and hence all of the tooling, such as wallets and UIs, built for Ethereum works on Ethermint.

## Peg Zone 'Peggy'

The [peg zone 'Peggy'](https://ether.peg.zone) allows Ethereum users to move their Ether or ERC20 tokens to the Cosmos Hub. On the Cosmos Hub they can be exchanged at a much faster rate. Furthermore, the Hub allows movement of those tokens to specialized payment or EVM zones, where users can access their tokens. Peggy allows any user to withdraw their tokens back to Ethereum in a permissionless way.

## Tendermint Plasma

[Tendermint Plasma](https://github.com/cosmos/plasma) allows projects to build their dedicated blockchains applications using the Cosmos-SDK, while their tokens are staked on Ethereum. This means that projects won't have to adapt to a new security model, but can rather rely on the security properties of Ethereum, while benefiting from much higher transaction throughput on the Tendermint child chain.

## Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is an ABCI framework written in Golang that affords you all the tools you need to rapidly develop robust blockchains and blockchain applications which are interoperable with the Cosmos Hub. It is a blockchain development 'starter-pack' of common blockchain modules while not enforcing their use thus giving maximum flexibility for application customization. It is perfect to build highly-customizable public proof-of-stake blockchains.
