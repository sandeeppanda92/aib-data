# Wallet Design

## Overview

We will explain to developers how they can build their own wallet for the Cosmos Hub.

* Will describe how to run a gaia full-node
* Will describe the HTTP/RPC endpoints exposed by that node
* Will demo [Cosmos Voyager](/voyager) and explain which endpoints it uses and why
* Will explain how light-nodes exposes the same HTTP/RPC endpoints

## Goals

* Help external wallet teams understand how to easily build on top of the exposed endpoints
* Help mobile app developers use the light-node to build wallet software for the Cosmos Hub

## Discuss with us

Don't want to wait for docs to build your wallet? Chat with us on [developer chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cosmos:matrix.org) and we'll help you out.
