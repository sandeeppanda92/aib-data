The Parity and Geth clients have released (differing?) updates that let the miner choose whether to soft-fork, or not.

The arguments in favor of mitigating the hack is clear. Few in the Ethereum community really want 5% of the entire token supply of Ethereum to go to the hacker — the actual DAO experiment hadn’t even begun! And yet, a coordinated action to reverse the attack or freeze the stolen funds is to undermine Ethereum’s stated premise. Some argue that to do so would destroy the very purpose and value of Ethereum.</p><h3 name="a01d" id="a01d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Ethereum Could Do</h3><p name="8016" id="8016" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are four parties involved in TheDAO attack.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4b94" id="4b94" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The DAO token holders (DTH)</li><li name="b76d" id="b76d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The ether holders</li><li name="5f50" id="5f50" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The Ethereum miners</li><li name="04ca" id="04ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Everyone else</li></ul><p name="e639" id="e639" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The DAO token holders (DTH)</em> are quite obviously the victim of this tragedy. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The ether holders</em> are necessarily involved because most of the suggested courses of action start with a soft-fork to freeze the attacker’s funds currently held locked in the child DAO.

Some claim that Bitcoin and Ethereum are in competition with each other. Thus, the Ethereum community would be wise to note that there is probably a distributed Sybil attack in social media to confuse Ethereum while it is vulnerable.</p><p name="79cd" id="79cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In short, any discussion in social media concerning what Ethereum “ought to do” or any comments about what will or will not happen to Ethereum with any decision, ought to be taken with a grain of salt. Any polling of the Ethereum community should be done via cryptographic signatures from current ether holders. Any polling of the Ethereum miners should be done via the mining process.</p><h3 name="518a" id="518a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Intention of TheDAO Investors</h3><p name="8797" id="8797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s pretty obvious that the “feature” that enabled the hacker to abscond with TheDAO’s ether was indeed a bug. Arguments that it isn’t a bug generally point to two things: the text of TheDAO’s terms and conditions, and the stated premise of Ethereum. For the former, we point the reader to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-17/blockchain-company-s-smart-contracts-were-dumb" data-href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-17/blockchain-company-s-smart-contracts-were-dumb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this nuanced article</a>, and we accept that the latter premise is flawed — more on that later.</p><p name="b1c8" id="b1c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The participants of TheDAO experiment were interested in seeing the investment mechanics — as written in English by the <a href="https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf" data-href="https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slock.it team’s DAO whitepaper</a> — unfold as a social and cryptoeconomic experiment. There were plenty of precautions taken to ensure that the DAO contract code was bug-free, and so many in the DTH weren’t expecting the funds to get drained before a single real proposal had a chance to see the light of day.</p><p name="e0d0" id="e0d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To find out, one could simply ask the DAO holders or the original funders with an on-chain or off-chain poll (with cryptographic signature verification, of course). However, noone is actually challenging the assumption that the DTH would vote in favor of a statement that claims that they were victims of grand theft token.</p><h3 name="0a45" id="0a45" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Too Big to Fail</h3><p name="b678" id="b678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some say that TheDAO should not be rescued for the same reasons why we shouldn’t bail out banks.</p><p name="a252" id="a252" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Comparing the rescue of TheDAO to the oligopoly of the too-big-to-fail US banks is a stretch. The analogy would be better had if TheDAO failed due to bad investments, or if it had somehow turned into a ponzi scheme. But that is not the case here. The very mechanism that was designed to protect the DTH were unexpectedly used against them. If any bank (or the Fed) were to roll back their database after getting hacked in a singular event, as long as it could do so and recover cleanly, nobody would complain that the bank were rescued.</p><h3 name="422f" id="422f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Moral Hazard — Tyrrany of the Majority</h3><p name="9d4a" id="9d4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some argue that a soft-fork or hard-fork would bring about dangerous moral hazard, that rolling back the hacker’s stolen ether is a case of the majority expropriating a minority.</p><p name="045c" id="045c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is mostly a matter of perspective. Once we drop Ethereum’s original premise, it becomes apparent that the former argument’s logical extreme would make the absurd claim that the “acquisition” of tokens via theft of private keys at gunpoint would also constitute fair-game. That’s perfectly fine as a personal subjective philosophy, but if society as a whole decides to counteract theft, the might of society is likewise justified.</p><p name="35df" id="35df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this light, not returning the stolen funds might be a case of a minority expropriating a majority.</p><h3 name="9ea6" id="9ea6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Moral Hazard — Slippery Slope</h3><p name="102d" id="102d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Some argue that once you allow one contract to be rolled back, you open Pandora’s box to allow anything to be rolled back. For example, a nation-state or powerful interest might compel the Ethereum Foundation to censor legitimate transactions with no victim at all.</p><p name="0c29" id="0c29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The way to get around this problem is to require a majority consensus from the remaining ether holders. For most issues that people would want a roll-back for, the ether holders would likely vote against the measure. But in the cases where a large chunk of the tokens are at stake, the remaining ether holders may prefer to allow for such a roll-back, if the alternative is deemed worse.</p><p name="6659" id="6659" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there’s an obvious problem with this solution. It would be very difficult to get a significant quorum of ether holders to vote for anything at all, because there’s no expectation for ether holders to be active in voting for proposals. The miners are a more active group, but they aren’t necessarily representative of the community of ether holders.</p><p name="7767" id="7767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While not perfect, here’s a sketch of what could be done for this issue and for future issues in Ethereum 1.0:</p><h4 name="4360" id="4360" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Polling the Ether Holders</h4><ol class="postList"><li name="9425" id="9425" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">First, construct a well written proposal that proposes a soft-fork to freeze the hacker’s child DAO. Come up with a reasonable deadline for voting, like 1 week. Post this proposal on social media.</li><li name="5152" id="5152" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Program a simple smart contract that accepts a signed transaction by ether holders. For the sake of our collective sanity this contract won’t accept any ether. It doesn’t even have to record anything in its state. The user votes with voting-power in proportion to their ether holdings. Only simple accounts can vote.</li><li name="74d9" id="74d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Right after the deadline, for all the accounts that have voted, note the amount of ether left in their account and count that toward the vote’s total tally. This must be done atomically at a single block-height, otherwise users might vote more than once with the same coins. Note that this requires off-line chain-scanning and computation.</li></ol><p name="22c6" id="22c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The result is a poll of the ether holders. It is far from perfect, because a lot of users won’t vote, and, ether held in complex contracts won’t get any votes. Also, it presupposes agreement about where to vote. But just maybe, if enough ether holders vote (e.g. more than 25% of all ether) and there is a super-majority (e.g. more than 67% in favor of a soft-fork, of those who voted), then it seems prudent to consider that to be a vote by the Ethereum community in favor of a soft-fork.</p><h4 name="f776" id="f776" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Coordinating the Ethereum Miners</h4><p name="3edc" id="3edc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Next, the miners should follow the will of the Ethereum community and prepare for a soft-fork. Miners could be required to announce their readiness for a soft-fork in each block. Once a sufficient supermajority has been reached (e.g. 67% or more) in a window of say 12 hours, all the miners can activate their soft-fork logic. For safety, it’s important that all the miners agree on the exact behavior of this soft-fork, and that they only soft-fork once a supermajority quorum has been reached.</p><h4 name="189f" id="189f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Preventing Spam</h4><p name="3d54" id="3d54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There is still the question of why TheDAO should get special attention while lesser contracts with much less value at stake might get ignored. Ideally there is a permissionless way to bring up all such matters to the attention of the community, but since community engagement of this sort is quite expensive — one could calculate how many man-hours are necessary to evaluate each proposal — maybe there ought to be a market or fee mechanism to determine what deserves the chance of a soft-fork freeze or a hard-fork roll-back.</p><h3 name="7572" id="7572" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">After the Soft-Fork</h3><p name="7553" id="7553" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After a soft-fork, if there is one, I would argue that the community should negotiate with the hacker to get back most of the funds, and let the hacker keep a small portion like, like 8%. Some people argue that the hacker deserves all of the stolen tokens. Others argue that the hacker shouldn’t be incentivized any further because they already had control over the timing of market forces (e.g. they could have shorted the market just prior to the attack). My opinion is that we should by default reward hackers a small amount for finding vulnerabilities, as long as they “voluntarily” return the vast majority of the stolen funds. A social contract to reward hackers a small amount would be akin to enabling an automated penetration-testing bounty system, and would likely accelerate security improvements, rather than hinder it.</p><p name="61a2" id="61a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To allow all such hackers to keep all of their stolen funds, in general, is to subject ourselves to the existing power structures that be, e.g. to nation-states with immense intelligence capabilities like the NSA. It’s great that we have a cryptocurrency whose premise is based on extreme crypto-anarchy (Bitcoin), but, if we allow all of our cryptocurrency systems to be coopted by the same technocratic bias, we deserve what we get. On the other hand, if we don’t reward hackers sufficiently, we risk creating a fragile house of cards.</p><h3 name="92e1" id="92e1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What About the Premise?</h3><p name="92c8" id="92c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Ethereum’s original premise was destined to change.</p><blockquote name="bd33" id="bd33" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“… a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship, or third-party influence”</em></blockquote><p name="a41d" id="a41d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Such a thing cannot exist in practice. Fraud happens at all levels, especially at the human level. For all we know, this whole DAO heist could have been premedidated all along — though the creators should be given the benefit of the doubt. Private keys can be swindled. If there is a sudden influx of legitimate transactions, the system can be coerced into dropping the majority of transactions. And there is always a chance of third-party influence.</p><p name="54cc" id="54cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some argue that dropping this premise would undermine the entire purpose, and therefore the value, of Ethereum. That’s hogwash. There’s great value to be had in a system that allows for the execution of contracts written as code. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Code as Law</em> doesn’t have to mean that the code cannot be revised if it is found to be buggy, in the same way that many existing legal jurisdictions look into the intent of contracts, in the case of typos or mistakes — code doesn’t need to be any different. Ethereum lets us write contracts in Solidity, to be interpreted by a virtual machine, rather by an army of expensive lawyers. Allowing for deliberated roll-backs does not take that value away. On the contrary, it would strengthen the Ethereum community.</p><p name="0ae4" id="0ae4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, it could be argued that the original premise of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">unstoppable code</em> is <a href="https://medium.com/@lemurvanstar/immutability-of-any-blockchain-is-an-unrealistic-attempt-at-perfection-that-will-never-be-possible-4e4fcae59804" data-href="https://medium.com/@lemurvanstar/immutability-of-any-blockchain-is-an-unrealistic-attempt-at-perfection-that-will-never-be-possible-4e4fcae59804" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">not desirable anyways.</a></p><h3 name="b2f2" id="b2f2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">An Alternative System</h3><p name="8c3f" id="8c3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here we describe <a href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper" data-href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gnuclear</a>, alternative cryptocurrency with a governance system baked in that can address issues of theft or bugs in a more streamlined and defined way. Gnuclear is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency powered by Tendermint BFT consensus.</p><h3 name="8872" id="8872" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Different Premise</h3><p name="57e4" id="57e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">First, we start with a different premise.</p><p name="7aa2" id="7aa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gnuclear is a multi-asset, scalable, proof-of-stake-2.0 cryptocurrency run by stakeholders, for the benefit of stakeholders</em>.</p><p name="ef7c" id="ef7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s no magic here, just a straight up business run by a distributed set of stakeholders using a BFT consensus algorithm. There are no impossible guarantees, and everything is up for change. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to use it. If the stakeholders come to a deadlock due to disagreement, they will have all the information they need to split, thanks to its design principle of transparency and accountability.</p><p name="5ef3" id="5ef3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stated a different way, the thesis of Gnuclear (and Tendermint) is that we can create distributed autonomous organizations built on accountable BFT blockchain systems that are self-incentivized and antifragile.</p><h3 name="a3a0" id="a3a0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Freedom to be Permissioned</h3><p name="ed8b" id="ed8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Centralized (non-blockchain) organizations usually function in a permissioned way. With a few exceptions, corporations get to select who they want to allow into their organizations. There are valid arguments for and against such self-interested discretion, but those who argue in favor of Laissez-faire cooperation often use economic competitiveness as justification. There’s no reason to think that the same can’t work in a blockchain environment, where validators in a proof-of-stake system must be permissioned into the network by some form of consensus.</p><p name="168f" id="168f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Besides permissioning of its validators and stakeholders, a distributed ledger can use permissioning at the application-logic level to create a better curated and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">well regulated</em> system for the benefit of its users. For example, imagine that each top-level contract in Ethereum has a mandatory field specifying which regulatory group (similar to TheDAO’s curators) can decide on whether the spirit of the contract had been violated by bug or by theft. Then, for the benefit of the ledger’s less-sophisticated users, the stakeholders may wish to whitelist certain regulatory groups at the system level.</p><p name="08e3" id="08e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This field could be left <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">null</em> if the contract developers wanted to explicitly allow for absolute no roll-backs, but at least there would be a standard so that client-software can inform the user about the consequences of sending money to that contract — like when visiting a website with a broken cert.</p><p name="6333" id="6333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Note that this not analogous to arguing for a walled-garden internet. The internet is composed of many independent domains with differing strategies on membership and permissions, and this has proven to be immensely valuable, enabling a Cambrian explosion of strategies. Nor is this analogous to arguing in favor of a federation of data-silos. Blockchains depend on transparency for their security. A federation of permissioned and unpermissioned distributed ledgers is not at all like a federation of data-silos.</p><p name="3a71" id="3a71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think of blockchains as sovereign transparent ecosystems, and the stakeholders of a blockchain as independent entities that are self-incentivized to make that blockchain succeed, in a sea of competing ledgers. Permissioning may be a superior strategy for winning market-share in certain niches.</p><h3 name="9686" id="9686" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Proof-of-Stake on Tendermint</h3><p name="727a" id="727a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Gnuclear is powered by Tendermint’s BFT consensus algorithm, and is thus is specially designed for classical BFT consensus.</p><p name="519d" id="519d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, it’s a known fact that in a non-synchronous environment (read: in the real world with faulty networks), no consensus algorithm can tolerate more than 1/3 of Byzantine actors. This means that if 1/3 or more validators are Byzantine, they could halt or fork the blockchain ledger. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote that Bitcoin can handle up to 1/2, but that only works because clients are suppose to wait on the order of an hour for confirmation, thereby allowing the network to be modeled as a (slow) fully-synchronous system. In other words, if you want a distributed ledger that can commit transactions to finality quickly (on the order of seconds), Tendermint offers an optimal solution.</p><p name="7f0d" id="7f0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More information on how to solve the nothing-at-stake problem and the long-range forking problem are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper#preventing-long-range-attacks" data-href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper#preventing-long-range-attacks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gnuclear whitepaper</a>.</p><h4 name="833a" id="833a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Gnuclear Governance</h4><p name="24d5" id="24d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">That a 1/3 coalition of Byzantine voting power can halt the network in Tendermint necessitates an interesting governance model in Gnuclear in order to prevent halts from happening, which would result in decreased revenue and confidence in the ledger. In other words, since a 1/3 coalition can temporarily halt the ledger, it creates an incentive for the stakeholders to find a compromise.</p><p name="606e" id="606e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Gnuclear proposal system polls the stakeholders to see what they would do if the proposal were passed, and calls off the proposal if it appears that the proposal is contentious enough to cause a halt or filibuster. Instead of actually halting the blockchain and punishing everyone, it imposes a slight penalty for everyone involved.</p><blockquote name="1a26" id="1a26" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">For each proposal, voters may vote with the following options:</em></blockquote><blockquote name="3c75" id="3c75" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">* Yay</blockquote><blockquote name="7555" id="7555" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">* YayWithForce</blockquote><blockquote name="90eb" id="90eb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">* Nay</blockquote><blockquote name="7ab9" id="7ab9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">* NayWithForce</blockquote><blockquote name="533a" id="533a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">* Abstain</blockquote><blockquote name="2e4f" id="2e4f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">A strict majority of Yay or YayWithForce votes (or Nay or NayWithForce votes) is required for the proposal to be decided as accepted (or decided as failed), but 1⁄3+ can veto the majority decision by voting with force.

In Gnuclear, it’s a unified system — a simple majority is sufficient to pass any measure, unless there is a simultaneous veto by a 1/3 minority.</p><h4 name="4c74" id="4c74" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Need for a Constitution</h4><p name="6fb4" id="6fb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Some things can’t be easily automated as code. For example, determining:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a1fa" id="a1fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">whether theft has occurred</li><li name="8e63" id="8e63" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">whether sophisticated DDoS attacks are happening</li><li name="7a11" id="7a11" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">whether a contract threatens the integrity of the ledger that it’s in</li><li name="9bdb" id="9bdb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">whether a contract threatens the integrity of other systems or beings</li><li name="0a07" id="0a07" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">how to change the incentive strategy in the face of changing economic circumstances</li><li name="3cb4" id="3cb4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">how to react to other extrinsic circumstances</li></ul><p name="a22c" id="a22c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For these issues, the Gnuclear governance system lets stakeholders vote on human-readible proposals called TextProposals.</p><p name="53ee" id="53ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given such freedom in what can be decided by humans, even the best governing structures cannot prevent the system from disintegrating if the constitutents cannot agree on process. A breakdown of communication or understanding can quickly lead to a breakdown of live-consensus, and ultimately can lead to a blockchain halt or split.</p><p name="781a" id="781a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this reason, there needs to be a written constitution, or a human-protocol, that must be followed. In the very least, the constitution must contain the following:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3c41" id="3c41" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Validators must execute the blockchain protocol decided on by consensus.</li><li name="ccf8" id="ccf8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This constitution may be amended by passing a TextProposal.</li></ul><p name="b06d" id="b06d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Different ledgers may have additional elements in their constitution. For example, the constitution may provide guidance on what constitutes a theft or bug, and how to deal with it. Or, it may say that no validator may disuss soft-forks or roll-backs. It won’t guarantee that the validators won’t actually soft-fork the ledger, but it does allow the ledger to specialize and attract stakeholders with compatible interests.</p><h4 name="58b4" id="58b4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Stake Delegation</h4><p name="ab52" id="ab52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In Gnuclear proof-of-stake, there are three groups to consider: the validators, the staked delegators, and the non-staked token holders. The validators get to vote on any proposal (in fact, they must vote to avoid incurring a penalty). By default the delegators inherit the vote of the delegated validators, but delegators can override the vote manually.</p><p name="e70e" id="e70e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Non-staked token holders who aren’t putting their tokens at stake (and thus are not participating in the consensus process) do not get to vote on proposals. In a future post we’ll discuss the pros and cons of this design decision.</p><h4 name="b070" id="b070" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Accountability and Reputation</h4><p name="51da" id="51da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A major benefit of the Gnuclear proof-of-stake system over any proof-of-work system is about accountability and reputation.</p><p name="30e1" id="30e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take for example, the alleged hacker’s plan to <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/exclusive-full-interview-transcript-alleged-dao-attacker/" data-href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/exclusive-full-interview-transcript-alleged-dao-attacker/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bribe Ethereum miners</a> to prevent a soft-fork. Though this threat has little credibility until cryptographic evidence is published, the hypothetical threat is real. Since proof-of-work miners are completely anonymous with no associable stake in the system, there’s not a whole lot that could be done to prevent such a bribe, except to bribe even more. Furthermore, there is little incentive for the miners to be enganged in these political issues, so the alleged hacker’s note about plausible deniability is also real.</p><p name="759b" id="759b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Gnuclear, these issues resolved, because stakeholders are pseudonymous with associated stake, and validators are required to vote on all proposals.</p><p name="939f" id="939f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This pseudonymous reputation system also enables true antifragility. A blockchain split in a proof-of-stake blockchain is very different than a blockchain split in a proof-of-work blockchain. In a proof-of-work blockchain, nobody rational would follow a fork with less than 50% of the mining power behind it because it would be vulnerable to attack by anonymous miners <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">unless there were also a change in the hashing algorithm that required an investment in different kinds of hardware</em>. In Tendermint proof-of-stake, a blockchain split can result in increased security for both child blockchains.</p><p name="c9d9" id="c9d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">For a related explantion of Tendermint’s fork-accountability, refer to the Gnuclear whitepaper section on </em><a href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper#consensus" data-href="https://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper#consensus" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Tendermint consensus</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p><h3 name="fa39" id="fa39" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="de70" id="de70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">It’s people all the way down.</li><li name="4630" id="4630" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ethereum doesn’t have to cater to extremists.</li><li name="d362" id="d362" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Either way, lets create a diverse ecosystem of antifragile distributed ledgers.</li><li name="7e8c" id="7e8c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Check out <a href="http://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper" data-href="http://github.com/gnuclear/gnuclear-whitepaper" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gnuclear</a> and <a href="http://forum.tendermint.com:3000/" data-href="http://forum.tendermint.com:3000/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join the discussionsi</a>!</li></ul></div></div></section><section name="9b35" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="291e" id="291e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://gist.github.com/7df8ad84b748bb6c9b5c90927054d0f5" data-href="https://gist.github.com/7df8ad84b748bb6c9b5c90927054d0f5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gist.github.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section>
