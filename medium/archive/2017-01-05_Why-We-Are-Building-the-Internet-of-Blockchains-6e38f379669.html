It’s designed to be extended to incorporate future innovations. It’s a distributed ledger platform suitable for generations to come. B<em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">y </em><a href="https://medium.com/u/c010ef5a0ddf" data-href="https://medium.com/u/c010ef5a0ddf" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="c010ef5a0ddf" data-action-value="c010ef5a0ddf" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--h4-user" target="_blank">Jae Kwon</a> <em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">&amp; </em><a href="https://twitter.com/buchmanster" data-href="https://twitter.com/buchmanster" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">Ethan Buchman</em></a></h4><p name="f47d" id="f47d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">One of the great tragedies of cryptocurrencies has been the failure to interoperate with one another. Cryptocurrency platforms are competing for dominance with their own, largely incompatible technical roadmaps. It’s as if each blockchain consensus system with its own community is too sovereign for its own good.</p><p name="f921" id="f921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mechanisms like <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading" data-href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">atomic swaps</a> between chains can certainly help to link communities. However, where there are no technical issues, they often suffer from a need for mature liquidity markets and active participants on each side. Thus the “altcoin” ecosystem is an alchemical soup of enthusiasts experimenting in various ways. Many possess new designs and convictions, yet often each stands alone, siloed by the lack of a general inter-blockchain communication system.</p><p name="8719" id="8719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ethereum sought to address this problem, somewhat indirectly, by inventing a new platform for computation. Ethereum allows arbitrary financial systems to be written against a common virtual machine using a common development environment. Presuming all new cryptocurrencies launch on Ethereum, they will have some capacity for interoperability.</p><p name="ca1b" id="ca1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ethereum is in fact a wonderful idea. Its design decisions are motivated by important considerations such as the need for a simple specification and guaranteed determinism. However, it neglects elements such as the difficulty of designing a secure general purpose programming environment. This means Ethereum has its own sovereignty problem, as it excludes developers who want access to the platform but want alternatives to the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">state transition machine</a>.</p><p name="b350" id="b350" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ethereum also doesn’t address the problem of turning fiat currency into fungible tokens, short of having banks and government bodies issue currency on Ethereum itself. While many institutions are investigating the Ethereum blockchain, there are both scalability and governance concerns which ultimately restrict full-scale adoption. This may impede integration with existing systems and currencies.</p><p name="abcc" id="abcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much like communities, companies and nation-states, each existing cryptocurrency is born with the seed of some cultural ideal. Bitcoin is decidedly libertarian, with a slight anarchist leaning. Ethereum is less a political statement and more an avant-garde academic exercise in distributed systems, computer science and contract theory. Dogecoin is a testament to the capacity for humans to bond over the absurd, a phenomenon more commonly known as “being social”. Steem offers a more structured version of this same behavior, with a basis in content production and curation.</p><p name="01da" id="01da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so on, down the line. But there are many more viewpoints in the world, each doubtlessly wanting a unique experiment in the intersection between governance, culture and economics. It would be a tragedy for all these experiments to be so rigidly siloed from one another by great chasms of incompatibility.</p><p name="0eff" id="0eff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clearly, what is needed is something that can integrate the states of existing blockchains. Something that can interface in a sane manner with everything from novelty rewards points to currencies issued by nation-states. Something for formalizing relationships between systems, without compromising independence. Something with extreme flexibility without compromising security.</p><p name="4bb6" id="4bb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enter Cosmos, the “Internet of Blockchains”. Cosmos is a network and a framework for interoperability between blockchains. It consists of a web of hubs and zones, where each zone is effectively an independent blockchain with an arbitrary cryptocurrency design (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZeroCash, CryptoNote, your local banking institution, etc.). Each hub is a multi-asset cryptocurrency that facilitates interoperability between some set of zones.</p><p name="4385" id="4385" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hubs and zones are powered by the Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (TMSP) consensus algorithm, using the TMSP interface to host applications written in any programming language. TMSP permits enormous flexibility in application design and enables the application to inherit the security features of a Tendermint-powered blockchain. In fact, Cosmos is compatible with any Byzantine Fault Tolerant system, which is the basis of Tendermint itself.</p><p name="ae59" id="ae59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Zones communicate with one another through a hub, primarily in the form of asymmetric transfer of some set of tokens from one zone to another. Effectively, a hub is a blockchain with many sidechains, but using PoS instead of PoW leads to a dramatic reduction in overhead without sacrificing security. Each zone acts as a light client for the hub, and the hub acts as a light client for all its zones. Tendermint makes this efficient with compact light client proofs that are secure so long as the validator set is known. This can be achieved by ensuring the light client synchronizes with validator set changes at least as often as they are permitted to occur.</p><p name="01f9" id="01f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cosmos makes no distinction between hubs. There is no top hub and the most popular or successful hub is a matter of adoption by zones. Furthermore, there is no fundamental distinction between zones and hubs, such that any zone with sufficient functionality can become a hub. Cosmos will release one particular hub in order to get things started, the aptly named Adam hub. There is nothing stopping this hub from becoming obsolete, or stopping the likes of Bitcoin or Ethereum from competing with it and potentially replacing it.</p><p name="e573" id="e573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cosmos thus introduces a new kind of market dynamic that formalizes the friction points between various cryptocurrency offerings. It demolishes barriers to interoperability by enabling competition between hubs to contribute to the economic security of each hub itself. Validators who misbehave will be abandoned for better behaving ones. The result is a heterogeneous network — an Internet of Blockchains — adapting for each community and each locale according to its needs, all while retaining a backbone of interoperability. The goal is keeping barriers to entry low while holding stewards of the system accountable.</p><p name="1210" id="1210" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cosmos’ potential is building synergy and unlocking the power that exists in every cryptocurrency. As operators in one particular echo chamber of consensus systems design, Cosmos believes interoperability is the key to unlocking the collective developments of this industry. With the Internet of Blockchains, companies and individuals can utilize the services of one chain, without abandoning their existing investments in another. This creates a world that is fairer, more functional and better secured. This is a call for an end to echo chambers, and the beginning of bridge-building.</p></div></div></section><section name="e121" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="8a5e" id="8a5e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a href="https://gist.github.com/326dd21d19f641bea62b11cc58f4ab83" data-href="https://gist.github.com/326dd21d19f641bea62b11cc58f4ab83" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gist.github.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div></div></section>
