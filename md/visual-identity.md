# Cosmos Visual Identity Guide

2018-05-25

## Welcome

Firstly — Thank you for your interest in and contribution to Cosmos. On behalf of all of us Cosmonauts — welcome to the initiative. It is an absolute pleasure to have you as a part of this community.

As Cosmos has rapidly gained traction, the need for a consistent brand presence to unite our growing tribe has quickly become evident. This is the first official step in creating a united voice, tone and look to empower contributors to effectively and cohesively create branded resources that bear the mark of our initiative.

This is a “living” document that will grow, adapt and evolve along with the needs of our community.

As you start and continue to create Cosmos resources, please adhere to the suggestions and utilize the elements provided in this document. We are stronger united.

Thanks again.

## Written Name

The official way to represent the brand name in written form is with an uppercase C and lowercase osmos.

All other ways of writing or typing Cosmos are incorrect. Yes, our logo makes it look like it should be in uppercase. But in written form, that is wrong.

The only exception is when “Cosmos” is included in a headline style that appears in all caps. Try to avoid this if possible.

* Cosmos - correct
* Cøsmos - incorrect
* COSMOS - incorrect
* CosmOS - incorrect

## Logo

This is the Cosmos logo.

The graphical icon above is called the “brandmark” and the text below is called the “wordmark”. Together they create the complete “logo”.

This logo should appear on all Cosmos communications in one way or another. Consistency and visibility is important.

The logo below is the preferred version of the Cosmos logo. Use it as often as possible. Other acceptable versions of the logo will be presented in the follow pages.

## Brandmark

The Cosmos brandmark is designed after the staking token of the Cosmos Hub: the atom.

Its visual design is based on the famous Rutherford model of the atom, showing the orbital paths of electrons around a central nucleus.

The geometry of the brandmark is constructed with a total of six circles and three ellipses. Starting from 0 degrees, each following ellipse is rotated by 30 degrees, resulting in a hexagonal design.

## Wordmark

This is the Cosmos wordmark. This really should only be used in rare cases. It is preferred that it is paired with the brandmark.

The wordmark is constructed from the Gotham HTF Medium typeface. It has been kerned to improve the readability of a fully capitalized wordmark. A slash has been added over the first “O” character.

## Project Logos

Cosmos is a decentralized network, and it is constantly growing through community contributions. We have many projects under the Cosmos umbrella. Below are the current working versions of these project logos.

## Typography

Cosmos will be using the SF UI Display and SF UI Text fonts for all online and printed communications. Generally speaking, SF UI Display should be used for headlines and SF UI Text should be used for body copy. Exact suggested styles are forthcoming.

Both SF UI fonts are available at
